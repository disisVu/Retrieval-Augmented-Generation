Renewable energy refers to power generated from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Technological advancements in renewable energy, such as solar photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, and battery storage, have made these sources more efficient and cost-effective. As countries seek to reduce carbon emissions and transition to sustainable energy systems, renewables are playing an increasingly important role in global energy markets.
