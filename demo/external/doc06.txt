Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and rely on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers. Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most widely recognized. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems by enabling secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions. However, they also present challenges, such as regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.
