Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other elements of the Earth's climate system. It is primarily caused by the increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The impacts of climate change are wide-ranging, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity.
