The Solar System consists of the Sun and the celestial objects bound to it by gravity, including eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, and countless smaller objects like asteroids and comets. The inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky, while the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are gas giants, with complex systems of rings and moons. Understanding the Solar System helps scientists learn about the origins of planets, including Earth, and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.
