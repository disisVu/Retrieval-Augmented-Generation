Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way. Each block in a blockchain contains a set of transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered. This makes blockchain an ideal technology for applications that require trust, security, and transparency, such as financial services, supply chain management, and healthcare.
