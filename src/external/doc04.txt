The internet, a global network of computers, was first conceptualized in the 1960s as a means for government researchers to share information. The development of the internet as we know it began with the creation of ARPANET, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Over the decades, the internet has evolved from a tool for academia and government use to an essential part of daily life, enabling instant communication, commerce, and access to information for billions of people worldwide.
