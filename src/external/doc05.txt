The human immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It consists of two main components: the innate immune system, which provides a general defense against pathogens, and the adaptive immune system, which targets specific threats and retains a memory of them, leading to faster and more effective responses upon subsequent exposures.
