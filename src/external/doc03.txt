Quantum computing is a field of computing focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can represent and store information in multiple states simultaneously. This capability enables quantum computers to solve certain types of problems much faster than classical computers, such as factoring large numbers or simulating complex chemical reactions.
